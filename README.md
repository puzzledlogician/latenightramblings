<p>A website about general stuff, passtimes, and occasionaly the future (with an often cynical view to politics, sports and life in general). </p>

<p>As you may be able to guess, one of the many hobbies I enjoy to fill my (often) stretched spare time with, is that of sailing. 
Along with boat bimbling, I also enjoy building/testing model aircraft, or indeed those on a larger scale (<a
